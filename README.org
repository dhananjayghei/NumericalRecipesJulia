* Numerical Recipes in Julia

This repo contains the numerical recipes for optimization
and root finding algorithms from the Press et. al. (1992) book. 

All the algorithms are present in the [[dir:src/][src/]] sub-directory with the same
name as in the book. 

Usage of the algorithms can be found in the [[dir:examples/][examples/]] sub-directory.
